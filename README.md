# Cab-Service-Interface

Practicing my hands-on design and analysis of algorithms. 
This repository contains the code for a cab service interface that utilizes the **Dijsktra's Algorithm** with certain modifications and **Levenshtein Distance** algorithms. It also includes a **Java Swing interface** for ease of use.

## Features
Users can input their current location and desired destination. The interface suggests all the results nearest to input string and the user can select amongst the suggested results.  
After selecting the source and destination, user get two options: either to choose a minimum path route or minimum time route considering the constraints like traffic etc.  
The user can also select which type of cab he wants to use, and the cost will be accordingly the choice. The closest available cab is automatically assigned to the user.  
The Java Swing interface provides an easy-to-use graphical interface for users.
